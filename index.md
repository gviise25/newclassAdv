7 Best Places to Get Free Music for Your Podcast [2020]


It'd be great if you could Google your favorite song and make a clip to use as your podcast's intro, outro, or background music. Unfortunately, copyright laws and music licensing make finding legal podcast music a bit trickier to navigate.

In this blog, we'll show you how to get free (or affordable) podsafe music, and debunk some common myths around using copyrighted content.

Top 10 podsafe music resources (7 free & 3 paid)
Thankfully, there are a lot of excellent "podsafe" music resources out there for creators. All the resources on this list are safe to use for your podcast, but we still suggest reading the terms of service for each song carefully as licenses vary.

Best places to get free podcast music:

1. Pixabay: Copyright-free stock music by a community of creators
2. YouTube Audio Library: Huge selection of royalty-free music
3. Incompetech: Wide-array of tracks created by solo artist, Kevin MacLeod
4. The Free Music Archive: Expansive, free music library for podcasters
5. 909 Music on Soundcloud: Modern, cutting edge, podsafe songs
