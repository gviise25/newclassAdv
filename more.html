<p>1. The Calmer You Podcast

I have created a podcast that gives you the guidance and inspiration to be your calmest, happiest, and most confident self. Expect practical tools, expert interviews, audio hugs, encouragement, and a reminder that you are not alone. The podcast is available to listen to for free on iTunes, Spotify and also my website.</p>


<p>2. The Anxiety Guy

The Anxiety Guy podcast is created by Dennis Simsek, an anxiety expert, mental health author and blogger. As a former professional tennis player, Dennis struggled through a long six-year period with anxiety and panic disorder. He takes you through his past and former dark thoughts and how he eventually ended that anxious time in his life.

The podcast is designed to lessen and end generalised anxiety disorder, hypochondria, and depression. The Anxiety Guy exists so that hopefully you don’t have to go through the same mistakes and to help manage and end your anxiety. The podcast is available to listen for free on iTunes and includes great podcasts such as “Top 10 Words You MUST Replace If You Suffer from Anxiety” and “Life After Anxiety—6 Ways to Find Fun Again.”</p>



<p>8. 10% Happier

Dan Harris is an ABC newsman who had a panic attack live on Good Morning America. This led him to practice medication before releasing his bestselling book, 10% Happier, as well as an app, “10% Happier: Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics.” Dan chats to exciting and interesting people about whether there’s anything beyond that 10%. It is a fun and refreshing podcast with humour and intelligent guests. Listen to Dan’s debuting podcast as he sits down with the Dalai Lama and Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Centre for Healthy Minds, to discuss how you can live a happier life.</p>

<p>9. The Anxiety Coaches

The Anxiety Coaches are just regular people who happen to have experienced stress, anxiety, and PTSD, who now help others to overcome their struggles. The host, Gina Ryan, is an anxiety coach and nutritionist who struggled with general anxiety, agoraphobia, and panic for over 20 years. After using her professional knowledge, personal experience, and understanding of prayer and meditation, Gina finally ended her struggle with anxiety and couldn’t even remember when her last panic attack was. She brings you two new episodes weekly, which aim to help you overcome stress, anxiety, and panic attacks all while living a healthy lifestyle. Gina and the coaches talk in a conversational and fun tone, trying to answer all your health questions.

There’s such a variety of podcasts that you’re sure to find something that suits you. Whether you’re looking for something with a sense of humour or want more serious actionable advice, your podcast is out there. With hosts that are relatable, aware, and understand what you are going through, podcasts are an excellent way to cope with feelings of worry and anxiety.
