1. The Calmer You Podcast

I have created a podcast that gives you the guidance and inspiration to be your calmest, happiest, and most confident self. Expect practical tools, expert interviews, audio hugs, encouragement, and a reminder that you are not alone. The podcast is available to listen to for free on iTunes, Spotify and also my website.

2. The Anxiety Guy

The Anxiety Guy podcast is created by Dennis Simsek, an anxiety expert, mental health author and blogger. As a former professional tennis player, Dennis struggled through a long six-year period with anxiety and panic disorder. He takes you through his past and former dark thoughts and how he eventually ended that anxious time in his life.

The podcast is designed to lessen and end generalised anxiety disorder, hypochondria, and depression. The Anxiety Guy exists so that hopefully you don’t have to go through the same mistakes and to help manage and end your anxiety. The podcast is available to listen for free on iTunes and includes great podcasts such as “Top 10 Words You MUST Replace If You Suffer from Anxiety” and “Life After Anxiety—6 Ways to Find Fun Again.”

3. The Overwhelmed Brain

Designed for personal growth and for people who want to better their lives and change their behaviour, The Overwhelmed Brain podcast is created by Paul Colaianni. Back in 2005, Paul fell into a depression after a 13-year relationship came to an abrupt end. Several years later with a lot of learning and a massive shift in thinking and behaviour, The Overwhelmed Brain came to fruition. A blog as well as a podcast, its aim is to help you break through negative thoughts and empower you to live your best life. The podcast covers a broad range of topics including anxiety, depression, negative thinking, and much more.

4. Selfie

Selfie by Kristen Howerton, a writer and psychotherapist, and Sarah James, a lifestyle blogger, focuses on all areas of self-care. If you’re looking for something with a sense of humour then Selfie is the podcast for you. They tackle a wide range of topics from the funny to the serious, looking at the mind, body, and spirit. The podcast hosts regularly chat to a number of interesting guests and cover anything from body positivity to comparing yourself to other people on social media. Although it’s not entirely focused on anxiety, it brings up topics that can cause stress and worry. Knowing that someone else shares similar feelings as you can be such a relief in itself.

5. Oprah’s SuperSoul Conversations

There’s nothing like listening to Oprah to lighten you up and make you feel like your rocking your best self. Listen to interviews with thought-leaders and best-selling authors as well as health and wellness experts. These powerful conversations can help lead to such positivity and, in turn, positive behaviours. Topics include “The Power of Visualisation,” “8 Rules to Happiness,” and “Life After Loss.” Oprah talks to a number of well-known people and experts including Dr. Phil, Amy Schumer, and clinical physiologist Dr. Shefali Tsabary.

6. The One You Feed

With your two inner wolves fighting, The One You Feed is for your good wolf. Created by Eric Zimmer and Chris Forbes, the podcast talks about anxiety, addiction, depression, mindfulness, and meditation. With a massive catalogue of over 200 episodes to listen to, the weekly podcast brings in experts and great conversation. It is hosted by Eric, a behaviour coach, author, and entrepreneur who at age 24 was homeless with a drug addiction. Fantastic podcasts include “Jeff Warren on How to Meditate with a Busy Brain” and “Eric Maisel: Rethinking Mental Health.”

7. Not Another Anxiety Show

Whether you’re a bit overwhelmed or feeling extremely anxious, Kelli delves into what anxiety really is and how you can find a way out of its tight grip. Joined alongside other experts, Kelli keeps conversations casual while offering practical tips, advice, and simple guidance to overcome anxiety.

8. 10% Happier

Dan Harris is an ABC newsman who had a panic attack live on Good Morning America. This led him to practice medication before releasing his bestselling book, 10% Happier, as well as an app, “10% Happier: Meditation for Fidgety Skeptics.” Dan chats to exciting and interesting people about whether there’s anything beyond that 10%. It is a fun and refreshing podcast with humour and intelligent guests. Listen to Dan’s debuting podcast as he sits down with the Dalai Lama and Richard Davidson, a neuroscientist and founder of the Centre for Healthy Minds, to discuss how you can live a happier life.

9. The Anxiety Coaches

The Anxiety Coaches are just regular people who happen to have experienced stress, anxiety, and PTSD, who now help others to overcome their struggles. The host, Gina Ryan, is an anxiety coach and nutritionist who struggled with general anxiety, agoraphobia, and panic for over 20 years. After using her professional knowledge, personal experience, and understanding of prayer and meditation, Gina finally ended her struggle with anxiety and couldn’t even remember when her last panic attack was. She brings you two new episodes weekly, which aim to help you overcome stress, anxiety, and panic attacks all while living a healthy lifestyle. Gina and the coaches talk in a conversational and fun tone, trying to answer all your health questions.

There’s such a variety of podcasts that you’re sure to find something that suits you. Whether you’re looking for something with a sense of humour or want more serious actionable advice, your podcast is out there. With hosts that are relatable, aware, and understand what you are going through, podcasts are an excellent way to cope with feelings of worry and anxiety.
